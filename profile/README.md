# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 👋  

## About Me  
I’m an experienced software developer with a passion for building scalable, efficient, and maintainable systems. With years of hands-on experience, I’ve worked across various domains, from backend development to DevOps, and I’m always eager to learn and adopt new technologies. My approach to development is rooted in clean code principles, test-driven development (TDD), and a focus on delivering user-centric solutions.  

💻 **Languages & Technologies**: Python (Django, Flask), JavaScript (Node.js, React), TypeScript, Go, Rust, SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL), Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Terraform, and more.  
🛠️ **Tools & Practices**: CI/CD pipelines, Agile development, Git, Linux, microservices architecture, REST & GraphQL APIs, and infrastructure as code.  
📚 **Learning**: Currently exploring machine learning with TensorFlow and diving deeper into cloud-native development.
